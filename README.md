## Contributing
If you have rolls that you would like tracked, either make a pull request with the changes or use [d2gunsmith](https://d2gunsmith.com/) and make an "issue" on github with the rolls that you would like added and any text you want them to show up in dim with. (On d2gunsmith there is an option at the bottom for copying to dim wishlist.)    

## Other notes
